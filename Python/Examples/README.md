# Examples

For your convenience we have provided a few examples of using this library to do simple tasks.

##Simple Relay Control

This example simply runs in an infinite loop and uses static set high and low GPIO commands as well as toggle GPIO commands.

## Simple GPIO Monitor

This example runs through an infinite loop and if the sensor reads a certain value then additional code is executed to read all GPIO statuses.
